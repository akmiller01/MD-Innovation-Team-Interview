## Brief

### Unemployment Insurance (UI) in Maryland

Using data provided by the US Department of Labor Employment & Training Administration ([link here](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDashboard.asp)), please prepare a roughly 10-15 minute presentation for the Maryland Secretary of Labor and her staff on:

1. Unemployment trends in Maryland based on claims data (e.g., initial claims, continued claims, and insured unemployment rate).
2. Evaluation of Maryland's unemployment insurance program performance using benefit timeliness and quality data (e.g., first payment promptness) compared to both UI PERFORMS [Core Measures](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/Core_Measures.pdf) and to peer states. You may choose how to define "peer states" but please explain your assumptions.
3. Insights related to claimant demographics or characteristics, including claimant industry or sector, that may help the Innovation Team and MDL develop tailored initiatives in the future.

Please focus on the most recent 5 years of data. You may leverage additional data sources to supplement your analysis.
